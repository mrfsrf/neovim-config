  --       These are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --       Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them.
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.autoformat',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',

  -- NOTE: The import below automatically adds your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    You can use this folder to prevent any conflicts with this init.lua if you're interested in keeping
  --    up-to-date with whatever is in the kickstart repo.
  --
  --    For additional information see: https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-structuring-your-plugins
  --
  --    An additional note is that if you only copied in the `init.lua`, you can just comment this line
  --    to get rid of the warning telling you that there are not plugins in `lua/plugins/`.
