  -- NOTE: The import below automatically adds your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    You can use this folder to prevent any conflicts with this init.lua if you're interested in keeping
  --    up-to-date with whatever is in the kickstart repo.

  --    to get rid of the warning telling you that there are not plugins in `lua/plugins/`.
